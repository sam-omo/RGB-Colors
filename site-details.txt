SCRIPT:
  Part 1: On clicking preview, the color values are read and the display area shows that color. The rgb text value below also updates to match.

  Part 2: Remove the preview button and use change events on the inputs. Also constrain the input values to force them to be between 0 and 255. Then add step, min and max to the color input elements in the HTML.
